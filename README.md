# Newlogy

Newlogy enhances the [Schoology](https://schoology.com) Learning Management System interface by cleaning up graphical styling, hiding some unnecessary user interface elements, and adding new useful features.

If on another browser, simply sideload this extension in developer mode.

## Goals
* Unify design
* Remove extraneous and redundant UI elements
* Simplify design language

## Changes
* Replace school logo with a simple "Home" link because we haven't even used Access since fourth grade
* Remove useless homepage "RECENT ACTIVITY" and "COURSE DASHBOARD" tabs
* Display course and group menus as a list, not as a clunky grid
* Remove course "academic year" label because you know what year it is
* Use normal capitalization for header tabs to match the rest of the interface and because the word "grades" is already frightening enough in lowercase
* Disable school-colored links, which are used unevenly and clash with the traditional blue color scheme
* Use fewer shades of grey for text
* Style buttons in a similar way
* Replace bizarre smiley faces next to like buttons with thumbs up emoji
* Automatically load posts as you scroll
* Add flag emoji next to language selection, because reasons
* Remove logged-in user's name from header because you probably don't need to be reminded who you are
* Several hundred other graphical tweaks
